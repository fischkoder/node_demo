### Node Sample Project

### Start Backend server
```
cd node_demo_srv
npm install
npm start
```

### Start Frontend App
```
cd ..
cd node_demo
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Hint

* To edit existing symbols, select the checkbox of each row then click edit button.
* To delete symbols, select the checkbox of each row then click delete button. 
* You may need to toggle off the "add form" to switch to the "edit form" vice versa.

### Solutions
* vue 3 as frontend framework
* axios for calling APIs.
* VuesticUI as UI framework
* Express.js as backend server
* Using fs to manipulate json file

### Further Improvement
* The backend path can be integrated by using express router.
* Optimise the Hide/Show of "Add/Edit" form by using router in VUE.

### Time consumption

As this is my first VUE project, it takes me longer in looking through the documents of VUE and VuesticUI

* 5 hours in reviewing documents
* 4 hours in actually development and test
